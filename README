NAME:
  Upstream Tracker - a project to monitor and verify compatibility of upstream ABI changes in C/C++ libraries.
  
  Web: https://abi-laboratory.pro/tracker/
  
  Please report an issue if you'd like to add some open-source library to the tracker.
  
  The tool is developed by Andrey Ponomarenko: https://abi-laboratory.pro/

REQUIRES:
  Perl 5
  ABI Tracker (1.9 or newer)
  ABI Monitor (1.10 or newer)
  ABI Compliance Checker (1.99.25 or newer)
  ABI Dumper (0.99.19 or newer)
  PkgDiff (1.6.4 or newer)
  
  You can use the installer to automatically download from github and install necessary tools: https://github.com/lvc/installer

TEST PLAN:
  The file "scripts/testplan" contains the list of libraries to be monitored. You can write several libraries in one line separated by semicolon if you want to handle these libraries one-by-one in the specific order on one CPU. Other libraries will be processed in parallel on two CPUs.

DAILY RUN:
  This script is used to organize daily runs of the ABI Tracker and ABI Monitor tools:
  
  perl scripts/daily-run.pl

LOGS:
  See logs in the "daily_log/" directory.

PUBLISH REPORTS:
  You can copy reports to a hosting defined by HOST_ADDR and HOST_DIR variables in the "scripts/host.conf" file. The script will copy all necessary reports and styles (compressed as tar.gz) via scp to the hosting directory:
  
  perl scripts/copy-files.pl [library]

Enjoy!
